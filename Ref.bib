  abstract = {People's health reports, including diagnostic information and medical prescriptions, are delivered in the form of test-based case notes, making it impossible to determine a person's prior health issues or medications taken until he or she returns to the hospital later on. Storing all of a person's health information in the cloud as a soft copy, on the other hand, alleviates this issue. To accomplish this, each and every hospital, dispensary, and laboratory must have an internet connection for the registration of patient data. A unique Health Id will identify each patient, and all of the patient's data will be stored in the cloud, where the specific patient can only access it. In order to prevent and treat illness, it is critical to perform an accurate and timely analysis on any health-related problem. The ability to diagnose disease by obtaining all information from a linked Health ID combined with Machine Learning techniques will improve the system's ability to detect diseases. We believe that our diagnostic model can operate like a doctor in the earlier diagnosis of this disease, allowing for timely treatment and the preservation of life.},

  abstract = {Sentiment analysis is performed to extract opinion and subjectivity knowledge from user generated text content. This is contextually different from traditional topic based text classification since it involves classifying opinionated text according to the sentiment conveyed by it. Feature selection is a critical task in sentiment analysis and effectively selected representative features from subjective text can improve sentiment based classification. This paper explores the applicability of five commonly used feature selection methods in data mining research (DF, IG, GR, CHI and Relief-F) and seven machine learning based classification techniques (Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Maximum Entropy, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Winnow, Adaboost) for sentiment analysis on online movie reviews dataset. The paper demonstrates that feature selection does improve the performance of sentiment based classification, but it depends on the method adopted and the number of feature selected. The experimental results presented in this paper show that Gain Ratio gives the best performance for sentimental feature selection, and SVM performs better than other techniques for sentiment based classification.},

  abstract={There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to provide more transparency to their algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a ‘good’ explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

    abstract = {A promising alternative to standard control strategies for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and blinds positioning of buildings is Model Predictive Control (MPC). Key to MPC is having a sufficiently simple (preferably linear) model of the building's thermal dynamics. In this paper, we propose and test a general approach to derive MPC compatible models consisting of the following steps: First, we use standard geometry and construction data to derive in an automated way a physical first-principles based linear model of the building's thermal dynamics. This describes the evolution of room, wall, floor and ceiling temperatures on a per zone level as a function of external heat fluxes (e.g., solar gains, heating/cooling system heat fluxes etc.). Second, we model the external heat fluxes as linear functions of control inputs and predictable disturbances. Third, we tune a limited number of physically meaningful parameters. Finally, we use model reduction to derive a low-order model that is suitable for MPC. The full-scale and low-order models were tuned with and compared to a validated EnergyPlus building simulation software model. The approach was successfully applied to the modeling of a representative Swiss office building. The proposed modular approach flexibly supports stepwise model refinements and integration of models for the building's technical subsystems.},

To meet this need the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) published guidelines for a systematic approach for sequence variant interpretation in 2015. This framework is intended to be adaptable to any Mendelian condition, promoting transparency and consistency in variant interpretation, yet its comprehensive nature yields important challenges and caveats that end users must understand. In this review, we address some of these nuances and discuss the evolving efforts to refine and adapt this framework. We also consider the added complexity of distinguishing between variant-level interpretations and case-level conclusions, particularly in the context of the large gene panel approach to clinical diagnostics.},

  abstract={In science and medicine, model interpretations may be reported as discoveries of natural phenomena or used to guide patient treatments. In such high-stakes tasks, false discoveries may lead investigators astray. These applications would therefore benefit from control over the finite-sample error rate of interpretations. We reframe black box model interpretability as a multiple hypothesis testing problem. The task is to discover "important" features by testing whether the model prediction is significantly different from what would be expected if the features were replaced with uninformative counterfactuals. We propose two testing methods: one that provably controls the false discovery rate but which is not yet feasible for large-scale applications, and an approximate testing method which can be applied to real-world data sets. In simulation, both tests have high power relative to existing interpretability methods. When applied to state-of-the-art vision and language models, the framework selects features that intuitively explain model predictions. The resulting explanations have the additional advantage that they are themselves easy to interpret.}

  abstract = {A big data analytics-enabled transformation model based on practice-based view is developed, which reveals the causal relationships among big data analytics capabilities, IT-enabled transformation practices, benefit dimensions, and business values. This model was then tested in healthcare setting. By analyzing big data implementation cases, we sought to understand how big data analytics capabilities transform organizational practices, thereby generating potential benefits. In addition to conceptually defining four big data analytics capabilities, the model offers a strategic view of big data analytics. Three significant path-to-value chains were identified for healthcare organizations by applying the model, which provides practical insights for managers.},
